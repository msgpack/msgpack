MessagePack
===========

MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It's like JSON. but fast and small.

This repository manages the specification of the MessagePack format.
The current specification is [Version 2.0](spec.md). The older [Version 1.0](spec-old.md) specification is also available.

Implementation projects have each own repository. See [msgpack.org](http://msgpack.org/) website to find implementations and their documents.

If you'd like to show your msgpack implementation to the [msgpack.org](http://msgpack.org/) website, please follow the [website document](https://github.com/msgpack/website).
