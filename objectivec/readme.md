PROJECT HAS MOVED
====
The official msgpack project has now accepted this project of mine into their repo, so for the latest code you should go here:

MessagePack for Objective-C / iPhone
============

This is a wrapper for the C MessagePack parser, building the bridge to Objective-C.
In a similar way to the JSON framework, this parses MessagePack into NSDictionaries, NSArrays, NSNumbers, NSStrings, and NSNulls.
This contains a small patch to the C library so that it doesn't segfault with a byte alignment error when running on the iPhone in armv7 mode.
Please note that the parser has been extensively tested, however the packer has not been. Please get in touch if it has issues.

Parsing Usage
-----

	#import "MessagePack.h"
	...
	NSData* myData = ...
	NSDictionary* parsed = [myData messagePackParse];
	NSLog(@"%@", [parsed description]);

Packing Usage
----

    #import "MessagePack.h"
    ..
    NSData* packed = [someArray messagePack];
    NSData* packed = [someDictionary messagePack];
